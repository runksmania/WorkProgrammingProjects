# Work
This is where I put work projects.

- Unlock The Box
  - This was a promotion we ran at the casino I work at.  I created this program to keep track of customers who had previously won, and prizes previously won.  The prize file has all the prizes we were giving away as a part of the promtion, and the customer file would update when a customer won.  The program in addition to the above features also generated a offer for me to give customers to buy the prize box they picked back from them, similar to the game show Deal or No Deal.
